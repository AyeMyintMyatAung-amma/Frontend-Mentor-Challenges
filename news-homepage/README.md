## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I am more comfortable with using Flexbox but for this project just using Flexbox is not enough. So, I have to read more about Grid. And fortunately, I stumbled upon [this grid generator website](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/) and it made creating layouts so much easier for me.
