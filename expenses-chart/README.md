## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- JavaScript Fetch API
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

- During the Expenses Chart Component challenge, I had the opportunity to work with Tailwind CSS framework and use the Fetch API to retrieve JSON data from json file provided. Through this project, I was able to gain valuable experience and insights into the power and flexibility of Tailwind CSS.
- One of the main things I learned while working on this challenge was how to use Tailwind CSS classes effectively to quickly and efficiently style my components. I was impressed with how easy it was to create responsive layouts and implement custom styles using Tailwind CSS utilities.
- Additionally, working with the Fetch API allowed me to understand how to fetch data from external sources and use that data to dynamically update the UI. This skill will be incredibly valuable in future projects, as I can use it to create more dynamic and interactive user experiences.
- Overall, the Expenses Chart Component challenge was a great learning experience for me, and I feel more confident in my ability to use Tailwind CSS and the Fetch API in my future projects.
